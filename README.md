# Sector-Analysis-For-Portfolio-Construction
## Overview

This project predicts the performance of Nifty sector indices using macroeconomic variables over the past 10 years. Models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM were tested to identify sector indices that might outperform the Nifty 50.

## Data Collection

- **Sources**: yfinance, World Bank, Indian Fama French Momentum, Macrotrends
- **Data**: Nifty sector indices (2011-2021), macroeconomic variables

## Modeling

- **Techniques**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM
- **Best Models**: ARIMA (R-squared: 0.7748), SARIMA (R-squared: 0.891)

## Results

- Models showed limited predictive power.
- SARIMA performed best among tested models.
